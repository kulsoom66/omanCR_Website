    <h1>OCPC Overview</h1>

        <p>The idea of ​​the competition revolves around three-person teams of students from the Sultanate’s
            colleges and universities competing in solving a set of real-life problems
            that require the design of computer algorithms to be applied as computer 
            programs during the competition sessions using one of the high-end programming
             languages ​​such as Python, Java, and C++. 

        </p>
        <P>
            <h1>competition Stratgy</h1>
             The competition (whether national or international) is held in
              one session that lasts 5 continuous hours, so that the teams are
               given the same number of questions, varying in their levels, 
               and the teams must solve the largest number of questions within the specified period.
                At the end of the competition, the results of the participating 
                teams are calculated based on the number of correct solutions,
                 the speed of solution for each problem, and the minimum number of attempts to solve each problem.</p>
